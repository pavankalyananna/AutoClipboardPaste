# ðŸ§© Auto Clipboard Paster (Java)

A simple **Java automation tool** that pastes multiple predefined strings one after another â€” anywhere on your system â€” by just pressing **Ctrl + V**.  
It automatically updates your clipboard with the next string every time you paste.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Paste multiple strings one by one with **Ctrl + V**
- âœ… Reads all strings from a **local text file** (each line = one string)
- âœ… Works system-wide using **global keyboard listener**
- âœ… Compatible with **Windows, macOS, and Linux (Kali tested)**
- âœ… Stops safely with **ESC**

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The program reads all strings from a local file (each string on a new line).
2. It automatically loads the **first string** into the system clipboard.
3. Every time you press **Ctrl + V** anywhere on your computer:
   - The current clipboard content is pasted.
   - The program automatically loads the **next** string.
4. When you reach the end of the list, the program stops (or can be modified to loop).
5. Press **ESC** to exit the tool anytime.
